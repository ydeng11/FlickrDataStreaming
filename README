Flickr Data Collection

This is a project for collecting the geotagged photos in FLICKR.

FLICKR provided an API for the convenience.

However, they can only return 4000 unique photos for each query. Thus I split the area, e.g. miami city, into 100 boxes. Moreover, the photos will be collected since 2005 by every single year.

Please enjoy and feel free to give me comment!
